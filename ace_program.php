											<h2>Anh Chị Em Program</h2>
											<p>Do you like family, food, and fun? Interested in meeting a cool group of people and going out for bowls of phở? Then you'll want to join our Anh Chị Em Program! You'll be paired up with an upperclassman who will serve as your VSA big brother/sister, with lots of opportunities for mentorship, bonding, and socializing. For more details, read below!</p>

											<p>In Vietnamese, <i>anh</i> and <i>chị</i> mean <i>older brother</i> and <i>older sister</i>, respectively, while <i>em</i> is a gender-neutral term meaning <i>younger brother/sister</i>. However, use of these pronouns isn't restricted to to siblings — they are also used among people of a similar age. For example, a college senior may refer to a college sophomore as <i>em</i>, while the sophomore would call the senior <i>anh</i> or <i>chị</i>.</p>

											<p><b>Learn more about the Anh Chị Em Program at our first general body meeting of the year! More details to come soon. Be sure to like us on Facebook and visit us at the Activities Fair!</b></p>
