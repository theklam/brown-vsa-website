										The VSA Dance Troupe, founded by Kim Pham '19, was created so students can learn more about Vietnamese culture through dance. In the past, Kim has performed at her church parish and at the annual Tết Festival in Boston. When she came to Brown, she was surprised to see that this was not something that was established in the VSA, and so she founded her own dance troupe. The Troupe specializes in both modern and traditional style Vietnamese dancing, and uses conical hats (nón lá) and fans (quạt) in their choreography. To your right, check out a video of one of their practice sessions!</p>

										<p>
										The Troupe is always seeking out new members, so feel free to contact Kim at <a href="mailto:kim_pham@brown.edu" target="new">kim_pham@brown.edu</a> for more information on how to get involved!
