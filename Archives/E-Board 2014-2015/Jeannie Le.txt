Hailing from the swamps of Florida, Jeannie Le was born to take on the world (or at least hug all of the sloths). Her calling is the Chemical Biology concentration with a minor in stamp collecting. As a former RPL and current CA, Jeannie can make you feel right at home in a matter of seconds. With a pony fascination like no other, Jeannie also plays tetris and performs in Lion Dance. Like a one-two combo, Jeannie and Mary work hard together to bring the best for our family.
