Michelle Hoang is a sophomore concentrating in Immunobiology. She's smart and ambitious, a scientist-in-training with biomedical research as her passion. But she's also someone who takes about 5 seconds to make a new friend. She has a huge amount of energy, kind of like Spongebob ("I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready!"). Coming straight from the beaches of Los Angeles, Michelle loves to swim and her active lifestyle absolutely demands a Lifeproof case on her iPhone. As a student at Brown, she's proud to be a WiSE mentor among other activities. So, her busy schedule to boot, Michelle is jealous of her cat for just sitting around; her best quote to date is, "I wish I was just a cat!"
