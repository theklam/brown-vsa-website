Now, this is a story all about how
Tung's life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how he became our VSA's vice chair 

In the Czech Republic born but not raised
On the soccer field was where he spent most of his days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And watching Chris Nolan movies when he wasn't in school

When we started this club, we were up to no good
Started making trouble in the neighborhood
We needed some direction, but we were leadership impaired
So Tung stepped right up and said, I'll be the Vice Chair
