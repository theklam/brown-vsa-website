Meet Vi, our spunky Social/Cultural Chair. She hails from Sarasota, Florida and is the only child in her family. Born in Vietnam and moved to the U.S. at the age of 9, Vi is a person of many passions. Not only does she study International Relations and wants to go to law school in the future but she is also an amazing artist! Vi is down for whatever adventures that are thrown her way. In fact, she loves to travel and hopes to see the world someday. She also happens to be proficient in French AND Spanish, as well as Vietnamese. 
Vi was a part of the team that revamped VSA in the fall of 2013, she has since helped rebuild the E-board as well as our base of members. Just because she is the only child, doesn't mean she doesn't know how to share. Be sure to chat her up at our events.
