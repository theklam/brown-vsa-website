Nancy, our lovely finance chair, is from the San Francisco Bay area and is studying health and human biology. She was born in Vietnam, and at the age of seven, she and her family moved to the United States. She is the second youngest and the nicest in her family, but by no means, do you want to mess with her. 
Nancy joined VSA in the spring of 2014, and since then, she has been a wonderful addition to our e-board. She keeps our financial account in order and helps us with applying for fundings. She is also an amazing cook. Her fried rice and coconut-mango ch√® are a killer, so make sure to try them when you get on campus.
