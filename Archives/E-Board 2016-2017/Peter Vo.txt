Hi everyone! My name is Peter Vo, and I will be the Culture Chair this year! I'm very excited to be planning cultural events with all of VSA for everyone to enjoy. (Hope to see you there!) My favorite hobby is being lazy; my favorite class is lunch; and my favorite place to be is front of my computer and/or food. You can find me on campus searching for quiet and peaceful places so I can blast my music really loud while (stu)dying for midterms. Together we can make America great again - I mean we can make Vietnam great again. But seriously, VSA is already a great place to connect with fellow students and spread Vietnamese culture. (P.S. If you're wondering what my favorite food is, it's cheese. Not all cheese; only some. However, you probably aren't wondering though so this message will now self destruct in ten seconds.)
