HI FRIENDS, HI. Iâ€™m Linh and I hail from Millis, MA. Currently a junior concentrating in neuroscience, but other than that, I concentrate a ton on penguins, elephants, bunnies, and just cute animals in general. My daily activities include tripping over invisible items and knocking over innocent objects (basically, I lead an exciting double life battling the dark forces of gravity). This is my third year being part of VSA, and since VSA has been such an integral part of my identity and time at Brown, I'm excited to give back to this amazing community and serve as your Co-Executive Chair (as well as being around awesome Viet food!) However, as much as I love banh xeo and hu tieu, my OTP has been and always shall be ~macaroni and cheese~
