Hello! I'm a 2nd-year student concentrating in Computer Science. Besides computer science, I'm also studying Japanese and I'm in the Brown Aikido Club. As for hobbies, I play the oboe, listen to classical music, and watch anime. Last year, I was a freshman representative in VSA. My favorite Việt foods are bánh xèo, chả giò, bún thịt nướng, mì quảng, and cơm tấm sườn bi!
