Hi there! I'm Kim, from Boston MA, and am a sophomore hoping to concentrate in Chemistry (Materials Track). Whenever I'm not freaking out about reaction mechanisms, you can catch me knitting or dancing with BBDT(Brown Ballroom Dance Team)! This will be my second year being part of VSA and on the E-Board, so I'm super excited to see new and familiar faces, as well as bring in new events and programs for our GB(totally keep your eyes peeled for our emerging dance troupe, highly recommended)! VSA is a great community to be a part of so I hope you'll drop by(and stay forever) and see what we're all about! :)
