Hi! My name's Alyssa. I'm a potential Biochem concentrator from Long Beach, California. I'm super excited to be a part of E-Board and can't wait for y'all to see the things VSA  has in store for this year! When I'm not studying, I tend to spend my time dancing, reading, and fangirling over dramas, manga, webtoons, and anime. Feel free to say hi to me anytime! \(^o^)/
