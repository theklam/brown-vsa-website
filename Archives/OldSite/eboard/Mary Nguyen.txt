Apart from being a senior, doing the school thing, and studying bio/health, Mary loves exploring new cities, learning their public transport system and eating their best foods. Her favorite Viet dish is Bo La Lot (seriously, SO AMAZING!) She joined VSA her first-year to #findherself, but ended up finding a family instead :)
