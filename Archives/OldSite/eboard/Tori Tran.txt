Hi frieeends! My name is Tori Tran and I'm a second-year from San Diego studying Biology. When I'm not acting as Publicity with VSA, I'm dancing with IMPULSE and Fusion and I also play club field hockey. If you ever need a friend to chill, hit me up and I'll have tea, cuddles, and Avatar the Last Airbender.
