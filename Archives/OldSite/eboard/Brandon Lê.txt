Hey VSA! My name is Brandon, and I'm a junior concentrating in Computational Biology. Between staying up late with friends to study and making late-nite runs to Jo's, along with sledding down College Hill during wintertime and exploring Brown's campus to find secret study spots, you'll often hear me say that Brown is the most wonderful place on Earth! When I'm not in the Sciences Library working on a computer science assignment (because that's what I'm doing a lot of the time), I do too many things for my own good, but they include gaming, music [production], consuming copious amounts of pho on a [bi]weekly basis, and graphically designing logos for everything.

 After being part of VSA for the past two years, I'm stepping up as an Executive Co-Chair this year! I am ready to do more with VSA than ever before, directly engaging with both the Brown and RISD communities to unite those passionate about Vietnamese culture and heritage.
