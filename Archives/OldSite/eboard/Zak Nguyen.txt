Xin chào các bạn, name is Zak, and my Vietnamese name is Tâm! I'm a student at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in the class of 2019 and am majoring in Painting. I joined VSA towards the beginning of my freshman year, and have really been enjoying my time getting to know the other students within this organization while learning more about Vietnamese culture. Although I do have some experience with Vietnamese customs and with the language, I continuously strive to learn more. 
Although I spend most of my time doing art-related things, I also enjoy running on a regular basis, volunteering/community service, reading comics, watching animated TV shows, etc.
