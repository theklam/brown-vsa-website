Hey there! I’m Arthur, a junior from Southern California concentrating in Health & Human Biology and Economics. As Vice Chair, I help plan events and work with the Executive Chairs to lead VSA. I’ve been part of VSA since freshman year and found a place in this fantastic community! You’ll also see me around campus writing for the IFJ and serving as a Meiklejohn for first-years. I enjoy cooking (especially Vietnamese food), eating copious amounts of ice cream year-round, and battling for Team Mystic. Feel free to reach out to me anytime!
