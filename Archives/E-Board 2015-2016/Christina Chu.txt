Christina Chu is a current sophomore from Riverside, CA with interests in a pre-med track. She enjoys making new friends, yet also finds great pleasure in binge watching Korean dramas. Christina's hidden talent is her great peripheral vision, even without her glasses, which has proven only useful to spot bugs. Her favorite food consists of Vietnamese spring rolls with peanut sauce, with banh cuon and cha lua as a close runner-up.
