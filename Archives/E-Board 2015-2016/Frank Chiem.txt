HI I’M FRANK. I’m from Houston (H-TOWN; CLUTCHCITY). Big fan of the Houston, Rockets. My main goal is to have lots of money, so I can spend it recklessly in the future. I also want to be famous (or infamous) in some type of way. Besides all that, I’m an alright guy willing to work with cooperative people. I’m grateful for the VSA because I’m surrounded by the greatest people on earth at this okay school.
