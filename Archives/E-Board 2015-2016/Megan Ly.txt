Hello! I'm Megan, a sophomore from San Diego, California. I am planning on concentrating in neuroscience and learning as much from the community of Brown these next few years as possible. I love to dance and eat incredibly messily; I am very passionate about nuoc mam and its many diverse uses. Being a part of the VSA family has made a very positive impact on my experience and transition into Brown during my first year. I'm really looking forward to making new friendships in VSA and seeing what creative projects we embark on this year.
