Hey there! I’m Arthur, a sophomore concentrating in health & human biology and economics, from Orange County, CA – home to beautiful beaches and the largest Vietnamese population outside of Vietnam. As you can imagine, I’ve been spoiled by the abundance of Vietnamese food, people, and culture, so coming to Brown has been a huge change for me. I joined Brown VSA in the fall of 2014 looking for a home away from home, and now that I’ve found it, I’m giving back and serving as our Finance Chair. With extensive past experience managing my high school’s VSA, I hope to bring a fresh perspective to the E-board.
 
I love cooking and wish I could do it more often during the school year. Some of my favorite dishes to make include crepes, pasta, bánh xèo, and gỏi cuốn. Oddly enough, I’m also a grammar fanatic, so the best way to bond with me is either over a meal or good usage of syntax. All kidding aside, I’m thrilled to be meeting all of you and making this year amazing!
