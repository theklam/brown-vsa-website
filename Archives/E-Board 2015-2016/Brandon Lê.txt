Hello! My name is Brandon and I am a sophomore concentrating in Computational Biology. Between staying up late with friends to study and making late-nite runs to Jo's, along with sledding down College Hill during wintertime and exploring Brown's campus to find secret study spots, you'll often hear me say that Brown is the most wonderful place on Earth! When I'm not in the Sciences Library working on a computer science assignment (because that's what I'm doing a lot of the time), I enjoy producing electronic music, eating bowls of pho, and exploring New England (to find more bowls of pho).

This is my second year as part of Brown VSA, and I'm very excited to be your External Affairs Chair this year!
