My name is Tung Nguyen. I'm a third year undergraduate and have been with the Brown VSA for two years now. I'm here again to apply ambitious and creative thinking to serve the VSA for Vietnamese-Americans, Vietnamese overseas, Vietnamese internationals, and anyone interested in the richness of shared culture, good humor, and outstanding company.
