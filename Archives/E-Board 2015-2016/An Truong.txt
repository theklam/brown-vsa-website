Xin chao! My name is An and I am a Political Science concentrator at Brown. Urban Studies and East Asian Studies also fascinate me (so thankful for the open curriculum). Outside the classroom, I enjoy a big variety of leisure, from dancing to self-teaching myself languages, from keeping myself updated with what's going in the world to taking unexpectedly long naps, from embarking on gastronomic journeys with friends to new restaurants to saving photos of cities and skyscrapers from Tumblr.

Born and raised in Vietnam, I am extremely happy and honored to be a part of Brown VSA and to be your Co-President this year. I will make sure you feel the energy that I emit and get to see my unrivaled cooking skills including rolling uneven nem and flipping banh xeo onto the ground.
