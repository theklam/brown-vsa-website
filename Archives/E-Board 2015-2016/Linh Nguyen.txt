HI FRIENDS, HI. I’m Linh and I hail from Millis, MA. Currently a sophomore concentrating in neuroscience, but other than that, I concentrate a ton on penguins, elephants, bunnies, and just cute animals in general. My daily activities include tripping over invisible items and knocking over innocent objects (basically, I lead an exciting double life battling the dark forces of gravity). I’m super excited to be a part of VSA for my second year and getting to be around awesome Viet food!! However, as much as I love banh xeo and hu tieu, my OTP has been and always shall be ~macaroni and cheese~
