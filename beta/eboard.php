									<h3>Kim Pham '19</h3>
									<h4>President — Brown</h4>
									<p>Hello! My name is Kim and I am a junior studying Materials Chemistry. If you’re wondering where I am most of the time on campus, you can spot me at Geochem in the NMR room or in a ballroom class at one of the auditoriums. Time permitting, I knit/crochet, hike (if an occasion were to come up) and cook Xoi (sticky rice). I’m super excited to be your Co-Executive Chair after spending two years on the E-Board and am looking forward to making this year a memorable one!</p>

									<h4>Vice President — Brown</h4>
									<p>Hi! My name is Harrison and I am an incoming Sophomore from San Jose, California. I plan to concentrate in Neuroscience as a pre-med. On my free time, I enjoy writing, playing basketball at the OMAC, watching TV (all time favorite series include AoT and Friends :^)) and catching up with friends. Also, I am a huge foodie who is always down to find or cook (*try to*) new foods!</p>

									<h3>Connor Walsh '20</h3>
									<h4>Vice President — RISD</h4>
									<p>Hi, I'm Connor. I'm a sophomore studying illustration at RISD. I'm interested in many areas of visual art but I primarily enjoy drawing and painting. Art is basically my life now, but I was fortunate to join VSA, which is a wholesome and welcome breather from the often engrossing nature of my practice. I grew up in Honolulu, HI, so Providence is a big change for me but I'm enjoying myself so far.</p>

									<h3>Jennifer Bui '20</h3>
									<h4>Culture Chair</h4>
									<p>Wey Hey! Welcome to VSA! I am a sophomore and engineering concentrator. I was born in Worcester, MA to two Vietnamese immigrants #firstgen. I currently live in San Diego, CA. The love of my life is my pupper Terry. He’s 4 years old! My favorite foods are fruits: mango, sầu riêng (durian), orange, nectarine, and hồng (persimmon). I am very enthusiastic, energetic, and hella snazzy, hence my “Most Extra” award from the VSA Eboard. In my free time, I love to treat myself with films and sweets. Y’all can catch me prancing with the VSA Dance Troupe making unnecessary purchases from CVS. My life goals are to take care of my family, inspire young people to pursue higher education, and become the greatest engineer. XOXOX JeNniFEr BUi</p>

									<h3>Alyssa Pho '20</h3>
									<h4>Family Chair</h4>
									<p>Hi! My name's Alyssa, a sophomore from Southern California. When not rushing from class to class ...or to one of the bazillion clubs I'm in (VSA, Daebak, BEAM, BTS...did I mention VSA?), I can be found whipping something up to eat or lounging around reading light novels.  Previously a part of VSA as a First-Year Representative, I’m super excited to be your Family Chair this year! As Family Chair, I help plan events and our Anh Chị Em Program. I hope you'll join VSA as we invite you to relax a little, have some fun, and join our family <3</p>

									<h4>Senior Advisor</h4>
									<p>Hey there! I'm Arthur, a senior from Orange County, CA studying Economics and Health & Human Biology. Last year, I was Co-President of VSA and named "Most Likely to be the World's Next Dictator" by the E-Board. (That's actually my fallback if I can't find a job after graduation.) This year, I'm serving as one of your Senior Advisors. On campus, I advise first-years as  a Meiklejohn, do research, and work for CIS. I enjoy cooking and eating food, though I'd stop short of calling myself a foodie. I long for warmer days and bánh mì in Providence.</p>

									<h3>Brandon Le '18</h3>
									<h4>Senior Advisor</h4>
									<p>Hey VSA! My name is Brandon and I've been part of VSA for the past three years, taking on the role of Senior Advisor for my final year here! I'm a senior concentrating in Computational Biology, the intersection of software/algorithm development and biological research. Between staying up late with friends to study and making late-nite runs to Jo's, along with sledding down College Hill during wintertime and exploring our campus to find secret study spots, Brown is quite the experience! In my free time, I enjoy eating bowls of pho, producing and curating memes, EDM music, and video games.</p>
